# Admin App Data Layer

## Goals

- Consolidate all network reads/writes behind React Query to enable caching,
  retries, and offline resilience.
- Keep mock-data fallbacks functional until Supabase APIs are wired in.
- Ensure every server mutation is idempotent and audited as described in the
  blueprint.

## Architecture

- `lib/api/client.ts` centralises fetch logic, injecting `x-request-id` headers
  for observability.
- `lib/api/queryClient.ts` exports helpers for creating configured `QueryClient`
  instances on server and browser and is wired through
  `app/providers/QueryProvider.tsx` for hydration.
- Query keys follow the structure `[domain, scope?, params?]`, e.g.
  `['vouchers', { status, search }]`.
- Server Components should use `react-query`'s `dehydrate`/`HydrationBoundary`
  pattern (now available via `app/providers/QueryProvider`).
- When an API route is unavailable, queries should surface degraded-state flags
  so the UI can respond gracefully.

## Query Behaviour Defaults

- `staleTime`: 30 seconds for read-centric data; adjust per domain if needed.
- `refetchOnWindowFocus`: disabled; manual refetch controls will be exposed in
  the UI.
- `retry`: two attempts on the client, none during SSR to avoid blocking. Extend
  with domain-specific logic for policy blocks.

## Mock Bridge Strategy

- Until real APIs are live, query functions can call existing helpers in
  `lib/data-provider`.
- Each query file should export both a direct function (usable by route
  handlers) and a `useQuery` hook.
- When switching to real APIs, keep the mock fallback path behind an environment
  check.

## Offline Roadmap

- Web App Manifest lives at `public/manifest.webmanifest` with placeholder icons
  and deep-link shortcuts ready for refinement.
- `app/sw/register.ts` registers `public/sw.js`, which currently ships a
  scaffolded service worker focused on install/activate messaging and fetch
  interception hooks. Offline queueing and cache warmers are stubbed for Phase 7
  ownership.
- Async storage persister package is installed but not yet initialised.
- Background sync and cache persistence will be configured during Phase 7 (PWA &
  Polish) once ownership is assigned in the offline roadmap.

## TODOs

- [x] Create `app/providers/QueryProvider.tsx` to wrap the app with
      `QueryClientProvider` + `HydrationBoundary`.
- [x] Define domain-specific query modules (`lib/queries/vouchers.ts`, etc.).
- [ ] Wire policy engine responses into mutation error handling once APIs exist.
- [ ] Document testing patterns for query-dependent components.
