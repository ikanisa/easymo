## WhatsApp Admin Approval (Phase-1 Simulator)

### Commands

- `SUB APPROVE <id> [txn_id]` - Approve a subscription with optional transaction ID
- `SUB REJECT <id> [reason]` - Reject a subscription with optional reason  
- `SUB LIST PENDING` - List all pending subscription IDs

### Phase-2 Integration

In Phase-2, the backend will:
- Parse real WhatsApp messages using the same command grammar
- Enforce admin phone whitelist from settings
- Update database and reply to admin with success/failure
- Use webhook at `/functions/v1/wa-webhook`

## Environment Variables

- `VITE_USE_MOCK=1` - Use mock data (Phase-1 default)
- `VITE_DEV_TOOLS=1` - Enable developer tools (WA Console, Reset Data)
