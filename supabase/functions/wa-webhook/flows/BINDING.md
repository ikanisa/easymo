# WhatsApp Flow Binding Instructions

Legacy dine-in customer/vendor flows have been retired. The `flow-exchange`
function now responds only to admin automation flows, which are launched
programmatically from the Admin Hub instead of the legacy Flow Builder. No
WhatsApp Flow bindings are required at this time. When future flows ship, add
them here with the updated binding guidance.
