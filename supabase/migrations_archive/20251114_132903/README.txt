Migration Archive
=================
Created: Fri Nov 14 13:29:21 CET 2025
Original Count:      254 files
Reason: Database migration cleanup - conflicts and duplicates

These migrations were archived because:
1. Conflicts with current production schema
2. Duplicate/superseded migrations
3. Need clean baseline

Restoration:
If needed, copy files back to supabase/migrations/
or extract from: migrations_backup_20251114_132903.tar.gz

Next Steps:
1. Create baseline migration from production schema
2. Push baseline to production
3. Resume normal migration workflow
