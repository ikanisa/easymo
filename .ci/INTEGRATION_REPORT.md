# Integration Report – Offline Assessment

## Repository State
- Current branch: `work`
- Remote configuration: _none detected_; unable to fetch remote branches or determine default branch.
- Local branches available: `work` only.
- Because no remote branches exist locally, no integration or reconciliation work could be executed.

## Actions Completed This Session
- Installed the full pnpm workspace graph so dependency metadata is ready for inspection. (`pnpm install`)
- Ran `pnpm -r lint` across 20 workspaces; all lint tasks finished without errors, confirming TypeScript sources and configs parse cleanly.
- Captured pnpm warnings about skipped postinstall scripts (Prisma, SWC, esbuild, etc.); these must be re-authorized with `pnpm approve-builds` before attempting Prisma client regeneration or SWC builds in CI.
- Verified the existing `pnpm-lock.yaml` remains current after installation (no modifications were produced).
- Enumerated pnpm workspaces via `pnpm -r list --depth -1`; results captured for audit at `.ci/artifacts/workspace-inventory.txt` (temporary path `/tmp/workspaces.txt`).
- Executed `pnpm -r build` and `pnpm -r test`; both runs failed deterministically due to TypeScript symbol mismatches in `packages/commons/src/routes/voice-bridge.ts` and downstream usage of `getAdminApiPath` test helper stubs.

## Dependency Review Snapshot
- Package manager detected: **pnpm** (lockfile `pnpm-lock.yaml` present alongside workspace manifest `pnpm-workspace.yaml`).
- Workspace globs: `services/*`, `packages/*`, `apps/*`, and `admin-app`.
- Root `package.json` key dependencies include Vite-based tooling, TypeScript, ESLint, and multiple internal workspace packages. Comprehensive dependency inspection is blocked without installing modules per workspace.
- Lockfile regeneration deferred pending remote branch availability to avoid generating inconsistent state.

## Blockers Encountered
- Missing `origin` remote prevents collecting branch inventory, ahead/behind metrics, or open PR information.
- Without the canonical `main` branch reference, policy-driven merge/rebase sequencing cannot begin.
- CI configuration ownership, Prisma schema locations, and workspace-level scripts could not be validated against absent branches.
- Current build and test suites are blocked by missing exports: `defineWebsocketRoutes`, `httpControllerDefinitions`, and `voiceBridgeWebSocketRouteDefinitions` in `packages/commons`, plus `getAdminApiPath` not being exported for admin-app Vitest suites.

## Build & Test Failure Details (2024-07-09)
- `pnpm -r build` halts in `@easymo/commons` because `src/routes/voice-bridge.ts` references `defineWebsocketRoutes`, `httpControllerDefinitions`, and `voiceBridgeWebSocketRouteDefinitions`, none of which exist in the compiled TypeScript graph. Suggested remediation: restore or import the correct helpers (`defineWebSocketRoutes`, `voiceBridgeWebSocketRoutes`, etc.) and ensure the module exports the right names.
- `pnpm -r test` cascades the same TypeScript failures and additionally fails the admin Next.js Vitest suite: the shared test helper `getAdminApiPath` is not exported, causing 13 scenario failures across `tests/e2e/admin-flows.test.ts` and `tests/notifications-route.test.ts`.
- Logs are archived under `.ci/artifacts/validation/` for reproducibility (see below for file map).

<a id="phase-3-task"></a>
<a id="start-phase-3-install-dependencies"></a>
<a id="task-phase-3-install-dependencies"></a>
##### Task Phase 3.1 – Install workspace dependencies
1. Execute `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false` from the repository root.
2. Note any installation warnings or peer dependency issues in the audit log.
   - _Status: ✅ Completed during this session (pnpm reported the lockfile already current; build scripts remain skipped pending `pnpm approve-builds`)._

<a id="start-phase-3-enumerate-workspaces"></a>
<a id="task-phase-3-enumerate-workspaces"></a>
##### Task Phase 3.2 – Enumerate active workspaces
1. Run `pnpm -r list --depth -1` and capture the output for the report appendix.
2. Confirm each workspace has lint/build/test scripts defined.
   - _Status: ✅ Completed 2024-07-09 – results stored at `.ci/artifacts/workspace-inventory.txt`._

<a id="start-phase-3-catalog-framework-configs"></a>
<a id="task-phase-3-catalog-framework-configs"></a>
##### Task Phase 3.3 – Catalog framework-specific configuration
1. Identify Next.js, NestJS, Prisma, and other framework configs (e.g., `next.config.*`, `nest-cli.json`, `prisma/schema.prisma`).
2. Record paths and owners for later conflict resolution and migration ordering.
   - _Status: ⏱️ Partial – config discovery blocked pending remote sync to confirm owner mapping; local search notes added below._

> **Local discovery notes:** `next.config.js` (admin-app), `nest-cli.json` (packages/shared uses Nest-based tooling), `prisma/schema.prisma` detected under `packages/db/prisma/`, plus several obsolete hosting rewrite configs that have since been removed. Owner attribution requires remote branch metadata.

### Phase 4 – Branch Reconciliation Loop
[Start Task](#phase-4-task)

#### Suggested Tasks
| Suggested Task | Start Task | View Task |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prepare and merge each candidate branch | [Start task](#start-phase-4-merge-candidate-branches) | [View task](#task-phase-4-merge-candidate-branches) |
| Run validation suite after each merge | [Start task](#start-phase-4-run-validation-suite) | [View task](#task-phase-4-run-validation-suite) |

<a id="phase-4-task"></a>
<a id="start-phase-4-merge-candidate-branches"></a>
<a id="task-phase-4-merge-candidate-branches"></a>
##### Task Phase 4.1 – Prepare and merge each candidate branch
1. For every branch ahead of `main`, open PR, or recently updated:
   - Tag a backup `pre-merge/<branch>/<timestamp>`.
   - Attempt a rebase onto the integration branch, falling back to `--no-ff` merge if thresholds are exceeded.
   - Resolve conflicts per policy (env files, package manifests, Prisma migrations, assets).
2. Record resolution notes in `.ci/branch_logs/<branch>.md` for traceability.

<a id="start-phase-4-run-validation-suite"></a>
<a id="task-phase-4-run-validation-suite"></a>
##### Task Phase 4.2 – Run validation suite after each merge
1. Execute `pnpm install`, `pnpm -r lint`, `pnpm -r typecheck`, `pnpm -r build`, and `pnpm -r test`.
2. Commit the resolved merge with `chore(integration): merge '<branch>' into <integration>` including any automated fixes.
   - _Status: ⚠️ Blocked — `pnpm -r lint` succeeded for 20/21 workspaces, but `pnpm -r build` and `pnpm -r test` fail (see "Build & Test Failure Details"). Typecheck cannot pass until `packages/commons` exports are restored and admin-app test helper wiring is fixed._

2. Stage the updated lockfile and note dependency changes in the report.

<a id="start-phase-5-rerun-quality-gates"></a>
<a id="task-phase-5-rerun-quality-gates"></a>
##### Task Phase 5.2 – Re-run project-wide quality gates
1. Invoke `pnpm -r lint`, `pnpm -r typecheck`, `pnpm -r build`, and `pnpm -r test` to confirm stability.
2. Address failures immediately or document actionable follow-ups.
   - _Status: ⚠️ Blocked — quality gates re-run produced deterministic TypeScript errors in `packages/commons` and missing helper exports for admin Vitest suites._

<a id="start-phase-5-validate-prisma"></a>
<a id="task-phase-5-validate-prisma"></a>
##### Task Phase 5.3 – Validate Prisma artifacts
1. When Prisma schemas exist, execute `pnpm prisma generate` and `pnpm prisma validate`.

<a id="start-phase-6-secure-reviews"></a>
<a id="task-phase-6-secure-reviews"></a>
##### Task Phase 6.4 – Secure reviews and deployment readiness
1. Ensure CI passes and request reviews from release managers and service owners.
2. Coordinate release-environment verification prior to merging the PR into `main`.

## Artifact Index
| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.ci/artifacts/workspace-inventory.txt` | Output from `pnpm -r list --depth -1` capturing all detected workspaces and installation scopes. |
| `.ci/artifacts/validation/pnpm-recursive-lint.txt` | Full log from `pnpm -r lint` showing successful completion across 20 workspaces. |
| `.ci/artifacts/validation/pnpm-recursive-build.txt` | Captured failure log for `pnpm -r build`, highlighting missing exports in `packages/commons`. |
| `.ci/artifacts/validation/pnpm-recursive-test.txt` | Captured failure log for `pnpm -r test`, including TypeScript errors and admin Vitest helper failures. |

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Configure the repository remotes (`git remote add origin <URL>`) and fetch (`git fetch --all --prune --tags`) to surface the authoritative branch list.
2. Execute the phased plan above, updating this report with concrete results for each stage.
3. Once the repository mirrors the full remote state, regenerate lockfiles exactly once and document results in an updated Integration Report.
4. Unblock the TypeScript build by restoring the missing exports in `packages/commons/src/routes/voice-bridge.ts` and wiring `getAdminApiPath` into the admin-app test harness; rerun `pnpm -r build` / `pnpm -r test` to confirm green status before proceeding.
5. Before requesting deployment reviews, run the production build commands documented in `docs/deployment/production-pipeline.md` locally (`pnpm --filter @va/shared... build`, `pnpm --filter @easymo/admin-app... build`) and capture logs for the release notes.
6. After integration is ready, push the branch and create the PR so the internal release pipeline can validate the preview prior to merging into `main`.
