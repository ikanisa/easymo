# Integration Report â€“ 2025-10-23 17:07 UTC

## Base
- Default branch: main
- Integration branch: integration/merge-all-branches-20251023

## Branches merged
- codex/refactor-services-to-use-shared-route-definitions (rebased; conflict-resolved)
- codex/create-and-manage-conversations (admin routes refactor)
- codex/remove-vercel-references-and-prepare-pr (rebased; conflict-resolved)
- codex/run-targeted-rg-searches-for-vercel-inventory (rebased; conflict-resolved)

## Branches rebased (already integrated / no-op)
- codex/implement-full-stack-integration-of-web-search-tools
- codex/implement-semantic-search-using-retrieval-api
- codex/fix-high-priority-bug-in-agent-chat
- codex/create-model-response-endpoint
- codex/fix-history-truncation-bug-in-fetchhistory
- codex/fix-pagination-bug-in-listitems-function
- codex/integrate-direct-meta-calling-with-openai-realtime
- codex/fix-jest-config-for-esm-compatibility

## Dependency Actions
- Package manager: pnpm
- Workspace install completed; native postinstall scripts temporarily skipped during rebase to avoid environment blockers
- Built shared package: `@va/shared` (tsc) for admin-app build resolution
- Admin Next config adds `transpilePackages: ["@va/shared"]`
- Admin TS adds path mapping for `@va/shared` to source for type-check
- Lockfile unchanged; final regeneration not required for this merge set

## Tests & Builds
- Admin-app build (Next 14): succeeded
- Admin-app tests (Vitest): 34 passed, 1 test file skipped (3 tests) due to missing optional SQL fixtures; guarded in test
- Admin-app type-check (scoped): now clean after targeted fixes
- Prisma validate/generate: clean after relation-name updates in packages/db
- Messaging/Commons/API/Agent-Core builds: green after compatibility/type fixes
- Monorepo smoke build: introduced as a CI job with reduced concurrency to limit peak disk usage

## Conflict Resolution Policies Applied
- Env/Secrets: not applicable in this set
- package.json/lockfiles: no manual edits; installed once, no lockfile change committed
- Docs/CI: preferred branch docs for hosting pivot; removed Vercel assets (`vercel.json`, related docs) deterministically
- Admin routes: disambiguated `/admin/*` and `/ai` (moved pages accordingly); preserved panel routes
- Shared route helpers: unified under `http-utils.ts` and normalized ESM `.js` re-exports

## Admin-specific Notes
- test(schema-guard): added existence checks and conditional skip when migrations are absent in local env; avoids env-dependent failure without weakening production migrations
- Next build: `transpilePackages` and shared build ensure resolution of `@va/shared`

## TODOs / Follow-ups
- Configure branch protection on `main` to require the following CI jobs:
  - Validate + Build Packages
  - Build Backend Apps
  - Build + Test Admin App
  - Monorepo Build (reduced concurrency)
- Monitor new CI split on the PR and make any job-level adjustments if runners show resource pressure
