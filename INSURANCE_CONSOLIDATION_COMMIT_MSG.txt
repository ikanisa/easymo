BREAKING CHANGE: Insurance code moved from mobility to insurance webhook

### Summary
- Deleted 2 redundant edge functions (2,272 lines)
- Moved 4 insurance files from mobility → insurance webhook (1,398 lines)
- Consolidated from 6+ locations to 2 primary locations
- Prepared database migration to reduce 12+ tables to 8 core tables

### Changes
**Deleted Functions:**
- ❌ insurance-admin-health/ (redundant health check)
- ❌ send-insurance-admin-notifications/ (merged to notification-worker)

**Removed Stub Directories:**
- ❌ wa-webhook/domains/insurance/ (stub redirects)
- ❌ wa-webhook-mobility/domains/insurance/ (stub redirects)

**Moved to wa-webhook-insurance:**
- 📦 handlers/insurance_admin.ts (from mobility)
- 📦 handlers/insurance_notifications.ts (from mobility)
- 📦 handlers/driver_insurance.ts (from mobility)

### Database Migration Ready

- Consolidates 12+ tables → 8 core tables
- Merges: quotes/requests, documents/media, driver/vehicle certificates
- Safe migration with conflict handling and validation

_shared/.../insurance/  # Shared utilities
insurance-renewal-reminder/  # Cron job
```

### Verification
