Pending Staging Plan
====================
Features to keep:
1. Voice Bridge outbound/Twilio integration (services/voice-bridge).
2. Admin panel hardening (admin-app, app/api, tests).
3. Metrics + observability updates (easymo/admin-app/lib/server/observability.ts, services/agent-core/src/common/metrics.ts, etc.).
4. CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml).
5. Prisma/Supabase baseline documentation/script.
6. Supporting lint/test harness updates (eslint.config.js, pnpm-workspace.yaml additions, test utils deprecation fixes).

Out of scope (leave untouched):
- New directories in "apps/", "agent-builder/", "infra/", etc.
- Additional supabase migrations beyond voice/admin changes.
- Unrelated microservice modifications (buyer-service, ranking-service, etc.).

Next steps:
- Stage files for features 1-6 only.
- Verify no files from out-of-scope areas are staged.
- Create logical commits per feature group.
- Leave heavy, unrelated directories as future work.
