# Phase 3: Refactoring & Code Quality

**Status**: Starting Implementation  
**Goal**: Improve code maintainability, testability, and documentation

---

## Phase 3 Scope

### 1. Extract Handler Modules ⏳
Break the 1000+ line file into focused modules.

### 2. Standardize Error Responses ⏳  
Consistent error format across all endpoints.

### 3. Add Unit Tests ⏳
80% code coverage target.

### 4. API Documentation ⏳
OpenAPI/Swagger specification.

---

## Implementation Order

Since Phase 3 is extensive (~4-6 hours), let's do high-impact items first:

### Quick Wins (30-60 min):
1. ✅ Extract response builder to util
2. ✅ Standardize error response format
3. ✅ Add JSDoc comments to main functions

### Medium Effort (2-3 hours):
4. ⏳ Extract handlers to separate files
5. ⏳ Add basic unit tests

### Lower Priority (2-3 hours):
6. ⏳ Full OpenAPI spec
7. ⏳ Comprehensive test suite

## Starting with Quick Wins

Let me implement the high-value, low-effort improvements first.
