fix(buy-sell): Correct category filtering in search_businesses_nearby function

PROBLEM:
When users select a category from Buy & Sell and share their location,
they receive "No results" messages even when matching businesses exist
in the database.

ROOT CAUSE:
The search_businesses_nearby() function was filtering by the wrong column:
- Used: WHERE b.category = p_category
- Should use: JOIN with buy_sell_categories and filter by key

The 'category' column contains raw scraped values (e.g., "beauty_salon"),
but the function receives the category KEY from buy_sell_categories table
(e.g., "Salon"). This mismatch caused zero results.

SOLUTION:
✅ Updated search_businesses_nearby() to JOIN with buy_sell_categories
✅ Filter by c.key matching the passed category key parameter
✅ Added performance indexes on buy_sell_category_id and key columns
✅ Lat/lng column names already correct (no changes needed)

CHANGES:
- Migration: supabase/migrations/20251208084500_fix_buy_sell_category_filtering.sql
- Docs: BUY_SELL_CATEGORY_FIX_SUMMARY.md
- Docs: BUY_SELL_FIX_QUICK_START.md
- Script: deploy-buy-sell-fix.sh

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Function now uses: INNER JOIN buy_sell_categories c ON b.buy_sell_category_id = c.id
- Filter condition: WHERE c.key = p_category_key
- Added indexes for performance on JOIN columns
- Returns buy_sell_category (human-readable) in results

WORKFLOW:
1. User selects: "💇 Salons & Barbers" (ID: "category_Salon")
2. System extracts key: "Salon"
3. Queries categories: SELECT ... WHERE key = 'Salon'
4. Stores in state: selectedCategory = "Salon"
5. User shares location: lat/lng
6. Calls: search_businesses_nearby(-1.99, 30.10, 'Salon', 10, 9)
7. Function JOINs: businesses ⟕ buy_sell_categories ON category_id
8. Filters: WHERE c.key = 'Salon' AND within 10km
9. Returns: Top 9 salons sorted by distance

OBSERVABILITY:
Before: {"event":"BUY_SELL_NO_RESULTS","category":"Salon"}
After:  {"event":"BUY_SELL_RESULTS_SENT","category":"Salon","resultCount":9}

DEPLOYMENT:
./deploy-buy-sell-fix.sh

TESTING:
SELECT * FROM search_businesses_nearby(-1.9915565, 30.1059093, 'Salon', 10, 9);
