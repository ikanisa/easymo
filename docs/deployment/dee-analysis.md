# easyMO Deployment Pipeline DEE Analysis

This document reviews the original deployment mission (GitHub + Supabase + Vercel) and evaluates how much of it is implemented in the repository today. "DEE" in this context stands for **Define ➝ Examine ➝ Execute**: we restate the directive, assess current coverage, surface gaps, and lay out an implementation plan to close them.

## 1. Define — Mission & Guardrails Recap
The mission requires an idempotent deployment workflow that:

1. Initializes or links a GitHub repository with branch protections, CI signals, documentation, and PR hygiene.
2. Links a Supabase project, codifies migrations (and Edge Functions if needed), and documents RLS plus smoke tests.
3. Configures a Vercel project with Preview + Production environments, correctly mapped environment variables, and zero secret leakage.
4. Establishes CI/CD policy where PRs generate green Preview deployments and default-branch merges ship to Production.
5. Captures verification steps, rollback procedures, runbooks, and open items in a final report format.

Guardrails: additive changes only, no secret values, instructions must be idempotent and production-grade.

## 2. Examine — Current Implementation Status
| Area | Expectation | Repository State | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery & assumptions (Section A) | Confirm repo layout, framework, runtime, assumptions | Documented in `production-pipeline.md` but not validated against operator inputs | **Partial** |
| GitHub repo setup (Section B) | Repo created/linked, protections enforced, PR template, branch policies applied | PR template exists; README/LICENSE/protections/CI configuration not implemented in code or automation | **Partial** |
| Environment matrix (Section C) | Names-only table, `.env.example`, Vercel/Supabase mapping | `.env.example` present; matrix documented in `production-pipeline.md`; Vercel import/export scripts absent | **Partial** |
| Supabase linkage (Section D) | `supabase link`, migrations workflow, RLS policies, Edge Functions scaffolding | Only narrative guidance; no CLI config, migrations, or policy files updated | **Not started** |
| Hosting configuration (Section E) | Project linked, build settings set, env vars assigned, domain + analytics decisions tracked | Instructions only; no deployment manifests, no automation, no recorded linkage | **Not started** |
| CI/CD policy (Section F) | GitHub Actions workflow gating lint/test/build and verifying Vercel checks | Workflow referenced but not committed; branch protection automation absent | **Not started** |
| Verification checklist (Section G) | Codified post-deploy checks with tooling/log capture | Checklist exists in prose; no scripts or automated tests | **Partial** |
| Rollback plan (Section H) | Concrete steps for Vercel, Git, Supabase | Documented in prose; no runbook automation | **Partial** |
| Final report template (Section I) | Template for capturing repo/URL/env/runbooks | Present in prose; no actual report artifacts or status tracking | **Partial** |

## 3. Gap Analysis & Missing Deliverables
- **No automation/configuration artifacts**: GitHub Actions workflow, branch protection scripts, or IaC (Terraform/CLI) are absent.
- **Supabase integration not executed**: no `supabase/config.toml`, migrations, or Edge Function scaffolding confirming linkage.
- **Vercel linkage unresolved**: no project metadata, environment sync tooling, or documentation of actual domains/URLs.
- **Operator inputs outstanding**: required data (orgs, tokens, domains, contacts) has not been collected or recorded.
- **Verification tooling missing**: smoke tests, health checks, or scripts referenced in Section G are not implemented.
- **Runbook storage**: resolved by adding dedicated runbooks, operator input, and final report templates under `docs/deployment/` plus a `status/` directory for dated reports.

## 4. Execute — Implementation Plan
1. **Collect Operator Inputs**
   - Gather GitHub org/repo details, Supabase project ref/region, Vercel team/project, domain choices, and compliance contacts.
   - Record them in a new tracked artifact (e.g., `docs/deployment/operator-inputs.md`).
2. **GitHub Automation**
   - Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build` from `admin-app`.
   - Use GitHub CLI (`gh api`) or Terraform to codify branch protections (required reviews, status checks, force-push restrictions).
   - Ensure README, LICENSE, and contributing guidelines reference the deployment workflow and branch policies.
3. **Environment Management**
   - Script environment propagation (e.g., `scripts/sync-env.ts`) that writes variable names to the release pipeline via the secret manager CLI and confirms Supabase secrets.
   - Extend `.env.example` with comments for staging vs. production values and include placeholders for additional Supabase keys (service, JWT).
4. **Supabase Integration**
   - Run `supabase link --project-ref <ref>` and commit resulting `.supabase/config.toml`.
   - Establish migrations directory with baseline schema, enabling RLS and policies via SQL migrations.
   - If Edge Functions required, scaffold `supabase/functions/<function>/` with example `index.ts` and `.env.example`.
   - Document smoke-test script (e.g., `admin-app/scripts/check-supabase.ts`) and wire into CI.
5. **Vercel Configuration**
   - Link the project via the internal deployment tooling and commit only the necessary metadata (exclude secrets).
   - Store rewrites/headers/build settings alongside infrastructure manifests; confirm the documentation reflects the new location.
   - Map environment variables to Preview/Production via CLI and document domain configuration (custom + preview URLs).
6. **CI/CD & Deployment Verification**
   - Update PR template checklist to require attached Vercel Preview URL and Supabase migration review.
   - Configure branch protection to require `ci` workflow and Vercel checks.
   - Implement automated smoke test job hitting Production/Preview endpoints post-deploy.
7. **Runbooks & Reporting**
   - Create `docs/deployment/runbooks.md` capturing add-env, redeploy, rollback procedures with concrete commands.
   - Establish `docs/deployment/status/` folder for dated execution reports capturing repository URL, Supabase ref, Vercel project link, and verification evidence.
8. **Validation**
   - Dry-run the entire pipeline: push feature branch, observe Preview deploy, merge to default, confirm Production deploy, run smoke tests, and log results in status report.

## 5. Outstanding Questions for Operators
- Confirm package manager (`npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`) and Node.js version alignment.
- Provide Supabase project reference(s) and clarify staging vs. production strategy.
- Decide on Vercel analytics opt-in and custom domain(s).
- Supply incident/rollback contact list and compliance requirements (license, security policy).

Completing the implementation plan above will transition the repository from documentation-only guidance to an operational, repeatable deployment pipeline.
