# easyMO Deployment Pipeline DEE Analysis

This document reviews the original deployment mission (GitHub + Supabase + self-hosted runtime) and evaluates how much of it is implemented in the repository today. "DEE" in this context stands for **Define ➝ Examine ➝ Execute**: we restate the directive, assess current coverage, surface gaps, and lay out an implementation plan to close them.

## 1. Define — Mission & Guardrails Recap
The mission requires an idempotent deployment workflow that:

1. Initializes or links a GitHub repository with branch protections, CI signals, documentation, and PR hygiene.
2. Links a Supabase project, codifies migrations (and Edge Functions if needed), and documents RLS plus smoke tests.
3. Packages deployable artefacts (SPA + admin app containers) and configures hosting infrastructure (nginx, docker/k8s) with zero secret leakage.
4. Establishes CI/CD policy where PRs produce green builds and default-branch merges ship container images plus Supabase migrations.
5. Captures verification steps, rollback procedures, runbooks, and open items in a final report format.

Guardrails: additive changes only, no secret values, instructions must be idempotent and production-grade.

## 2. Examine — Current Implementation Status
| Area | Expectation | Repository State | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery & assumptions (Section A) | Confirm repo layout, framework, runtime, assumptions | Documented in `production-pipeline.md` but not validated against operator inputs | **Partial** |
| GitHub repo setup (Section B) | Repo created/linked, protections enforced, PR template, branch policies applied | PR template exists; README/LICENSE/protections/CI configuration not implemented in code or automation | **Partial** |
| Environment matrix (Section C) | Names-only table, `.env.example`, hosting/Supabase mapping | `.env.example` present; matrix documented in `production-pipeline.md`; sync tooling absent | **Partial** |
| Supabase linkage (Section D) | `supabase link`, migrations workflow, RLS policies, Edge Functions scaffolding | CLI config and migrations exist but operator checklist not automated | **Partial** |
| Hosting configuration (Section E) | Container build recipes, nginx templates, secret management guidance | Dockerfiles exist; nginx template present; runtime secret sync still manual | **Partial** |
| CI/CD policy (Section F) | GitHub Actions workflow gating lint/test/build and publishing images | Workflow referenced but not committed; branch protection automation absent | **Not started** |
| Verification checklist (Section G) | Codified post-deploy checks with tooling/log capture | Scripts (`smoke-brokerai.sh`, `health-check.mjs`) exist; reporting integration missing | **Partial** |
| Rollback plan (Section H) | Concrete steps for containers, Git, Supabase | Documented in prose; no runbook automation | **Partial** |
| Final report template (Section I) | Template for capturing repo/URL/env/runbooks | Present in prose; no status tracking artefacts | **Partial** |

## 3. Gap Analysis & Missing Deliverables
- **Automation gaps**: GitHub Actions workflow, branch protection scripts, and registry publishing are still TODO.
- **Secret synchronisation**: no script to propagate `.env` values into the hosting stack; relies on manual copy/paste.
- **Operator inputs**: required data (registry URLs, contact list, staging domains) not collected or recorded.
- **Verification tooling**: smoke tests exist but are not wired into CI or deployment pipelines.
- **Runbook storage**: needs dedicated status reports plus automation hooks.

## 4. Execute — Implementation Plan
1. **Collect Operator Inputs**
   - Gather GitHub org/repo details, Supabase project ref/region, container registry endpoints, domain choices, and compliance contacts.
   - Record them in `docs/deployment/operator-inputs.md` (new artefact).
2. **GitHub Automation**
   - Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running `pnpm install`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, SPA/admin builds, and Supabase validation.
   - Use GitHub CLI or Terraform to codify branch protections (required reviews, status checks, force-push restrictions).
   - Ensure README, LICENSE, and contributing guidelines reference the deployment workflow and branch policies.
3. **Environment Management**
   - Implement `scripts/sync-env.ts` (or similar) that reads `.env` and writes values to Supabase secrets plus docker-compose overrides.
   - Extend `.env.example` with comments for staging vs. production and include placeholders for additional Supabase keys (service, JWT, webhook tokens).
4. **Supabase Integration**
   - Run `supabase link --project-ref <ref>` and commit resulting `.supabase/config.toml` updates when references change.
   - Maintain migrations directory with baseline schema and idempotent policies.
   - Document smoke-test script (e.g., `scripts/test-functions.sh`) and wire into CI.
5. **Hosting Configuration**
   - Maintain `docker-compose.prod.yml` and Kubernetes manifests with image tags, secrets, and health probes.
   - Provide nginx examples for SPA + admin (already present) and ensure TLS automation (Certbot/Let’s Encrypt) is covered.
6. **CI/CD & Deployment Verification**
   - Update PR template checklist to require container digest links and Supabase migration review.
   - Configure branch protection to require `ci` workflow.
   - Implement automated smoke test job hitting Production endpoints post-deploy.
7. **Runbooks & Reporting**
   - Create `docs/deployment/runbooks.md` capturing add-env, redeploy, rollback procedures with concrete commands.
   - Establish `docs/deployment/status/` folder for dated execution reports capturing repository URL, Supabase ref, container digests, and verification evidence.
8. **Validation**
   - Dry-run the entire pipeline: push feature branch, observe CI build, promote container images to staging/production, run smoke tests, and log results in status report.

## 5. Outstanding Questions for Operators
- Confirm package manager (`pnpm`) and Node.js version alignment for production hosts.
- Provide Supabase project reference(s) and clarify staging vs. production strategy.
- Supply container registry endpoints and authentication strategy.
- Provide incident/rollback contact list and compliance requirements (license, security policy).

Completing the implementation plan above will transition the repository from documentation-heavy guidance to an operational, repeatable deployment pipeline.
