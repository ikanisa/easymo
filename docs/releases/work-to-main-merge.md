# Work â†’ Main Merge Report

## Summary
- Prepared draft pull request to merge the `work` branch into `main`, capturing the latest fixes and features required for the Easymo platform.
- No dependency updates were required; `package.json` and lockfiles remain unchanged from the `work` branch baseline.
- Documented test coverage, review status, and deployment readiness to support stakeholders and reviewers.

## Tests Executed
- `pnpm lint` *(fails: ESLint reports a parsing error in `admin-app/components/baskets/UnmatchedSmsTable.tsx:188`)*.
  - Error output excerpt:
    ```
    /workspace/easymo/admin-app/components/baskets/UnmatchedSmsTable.tsx
      188:14  error  Parsing error: Argument expression expected
    ```
- Additional automated suites (unit, integration) are pending due to the lint failure; they should be retried after addressing the lint error.

## Dependency Review
- Verified that no dependency bumps or new packages are required for this merge.
- Confirmed the absence of changes to `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or other lockfiles during this synchronization.

## Code Review & Approvals
- Requested reviewer sign-off from the core maintainers responsible for front-end, API, and infrastructure.
- Lint failure has been flagged to reviewers with a recommended fix path (update `admin-app/components/baskets/UnmatchedSmsTable.tsx` around line 188 to resolve the syntax issue).
- Pending reviewer approval; merge should be blocked until the ESLint error is resolved.

## Deployment Readiness
- Local `pnpm build` should be executed once the lint issue is resolved to mirror Vercel's production build pipeline.
- Vercel production deployment confirmation is currently **blocked** by the lint failure; once the error is fixed and the branch builds successfully, production deployment should pass automatically per the existing `vercel.json` configuration.
- Deployment status will be recorded in the release notes immediately after Vercel reports a successful production deploy.

## Next Steps
1. Fix the ESLint parsing error in `UnmatchedSmsTable.tsx` and rerun `pnpm lint`.
2. Execute the full suite (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`).
3. Update this report (or PR description) with the successful test results and Vercel deployment confirmation.
4. Secure reviewer approvals and proceed with the merge into `main`.
