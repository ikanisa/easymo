# Production Readiness Audit - Summary Report

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the production readiness audit and hardening implementation for the easyMO platform. All changes are **additive-only**, **feature-flagged**, and introduce **no breaking changes**.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ PR-SEC-001: Security Hardening

**WhatsApp Router Enhancements:**
- ✅ HMAC SHA-256 signature verification with constant-time comparison
- ✅ Destination URL allowlist enforcement (prevents arbitrary routing)
- ✅ Feature flag support (`ROUTER_ENABLED` for emergency shutoff)
- ✅ Idempotency tracking (prevents duplicate message processing)
- ✅ Router log persistence (audit trail in `router_logs` table)
- ✅ Enhanced test coverage (signature validation, allowlist, feature flags)

**Security Improvements:**
- No timing attack vulnerabilities
- No unauthorized routing possible
- Emergency killswitch available
- Full audit trail maintained

---

### ✅ PR-SEC-002: Input Validation & Rate Limiting

**Validation Framework:**
- ✅ Zod schemas for all public endpoints
- ✅ Shared validation utilities (`_shared/validation.ts`)
- ✅ Proper error responses (422 for validation, 429 for rate limits)
- ✅ Request ID tracking (correlation IDs)

**Rate Limiting:**
- ✅ Deeplink resolver: 10 requests/minute per IP
- ✅ In-memory rate limit store with automatic cleanup
- ✅ Configurable windows and thresholds

**Validated Endpoints:**
- Deeplink resolver (token, optional MSISDN)
- Admin APIs (action, id, data)
- User favorites (label, coordinates)

---

### ✅ PR-DATA-001: RLS Policy Verification

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ 25 comprehensive RLS tests created
- ✅ user_favorites: Users can only access own data
- ✅ driver_parking: Drivers can only access own data
- ✅ driver_availability: Drivers can only access own data
- ✅ recurring_trips: Users can only access own data
- ✅ router_logs: Service role write, authenticated read
- ✅ router_keyword_map: Service role write, authenticated read active only

**Verified Policies:**
- Cross-user access forbidden

---

### ✅ PR-PERF-001: Geospatial Performance

**Index Verification:**
- ✅ GIST indexes on all geography columns verified
- ✅ Query plan verification script created

- `trips_pickup_gix` and `trips_dropoff_gix` (GIST)

**Best Practices:**
- Always use `ST_DWithin` for radius filters (not `ST_Distance < radius`)
- Use `ST_Distance` only in SELECT/ORDER BY
- Always include LIMIT clauses
- Combine geospatial filters with other conditions
