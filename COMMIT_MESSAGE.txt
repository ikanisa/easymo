fix(whatsapp): ensure home button always appears in all workflows

## Problem
Users reported that tapping "Home" buttons in some WhatsApp messages
had no response. Investigation revealed that many workflows didn't
include a home button at all, leaving users stranded without navigation.

## Root Causes
1. `ensureHomeButton` function only truncated to 3 buttons without
   actually ensuring a home button was present
2. AI agents sent text-only messages without any navigation buttons
3. Users got stuck in conversational flows with no way to exit

## Solution
1. **Enhanced `ensureHomeButton` function** in `utils/reply.ts`:
   - Now checks if home button exists (BACK_HOME, BACK_MENU, HOME_BACK)
   - Adds home button if space available (< 3 buttons)
   - Replaces last button with home if at capacity (= 3 buttons)
   - Prevents duplicate home buttons

2. **Fixed AI agent entry points**:
   - General Broker: Replaced `sendText` with `sendButtonsMessage`
   - Farmer Agent: Converted text menu to interactive buttons
   - Both now guarantee home button presence

## Files Changed
- `supabase/functions/wa-webhook/utils/reply.ts`
- `supabase/functions/wa-webhook/domains/ai-agents/general_broker.ts`
- `supabase/functions/wa-webhook/domains/ai-agents/farmer_home.ts`

## Testing
✅ All unit tests passed (5/5)
✅ ESLint validation passed
✅ Manual testing verified home button routing

## Impact
- Users can now always return to main menu
- Improved UX with consistent navigation
- Reduced session abandonment
