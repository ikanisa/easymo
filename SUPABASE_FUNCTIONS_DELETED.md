---

**Deleted:** 14 functions  
**After:** 81 functions in Supabase

**Reduction:** -14 functions (-14.7%)

## 🎯 Function Count Status

| Location | Before | Deleted | After |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|
| Filesystem | 95 | 15 | 80 |
| Supabase Production | 95 | 14 | 81 |

**Note:** 1 function difference because `agents` was a folder, not a deployed function.

---

## ✅ What's Complete

1. ✅ Deleted 15 functions from filesystem
2. ✅ Backed up all deleted code to `.archive/`
3. ✅ Committed and pushed changes to Git
4. ✅ Deleted 14 functions from Supabase production
5. ✅ Freed up function slots in Supabase

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Now you can deploy wa-webhook-unified!**

With 14 functions deleted from Supabase, you now have room to deploy new functions.

```bash
# Try deploying wa-webhook-unified now
supabase functions deploy wa-webhook-unified --no-verify-jwt
```

---

## 📋 Remaining Cleanup (Later)

After traffic migration complete (Week 7+), delete these 4:
- `wa-webhook-ai-agents`
- `wa-webhook-jobs`
- `wa-webhook-marketplace`
- `wa-webhook-property`

This will bring total to: **77 functions** (from original 95)

---

**Status:** ✅ All requested functions deleted from both filesystem and Supabase!  
**Ready:** Can now deploy wa-webhook-unified (14 function slots freed)
