3. **Documentation** - 79 comprehensive docs
4. **CI/CD Security** - Robust pipeline with gates
5. **Feature Flags** - Default-off discipline
6. **Observability** - Structured logging framework

---

## Methodology

### Tools Used
- **pnpm audit** - Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **eslint** - Code quality and style
- **tsc --noEmit** - Type checking
- **grep/find** - Pattern searching
- **git** - Version control analysis
- **Manual review** - Critical path analysis

### Areas Reviewed

## Timeline

```
Week 1-2: Blockers (DevOps + Database Teams)
├── Dependency updates and testing
└── Migration safety audit

Week 3: Go-Live Decision
├── Staging validation
├── Security review
└── Deploy to production

Week 4-5: Critical Post-Launch
├── Fix console logging
├── Fix module resolution
└── Monitor and tune

Month 2-3: Major Improvements
├── TypeScript strict mode (incremental)
├── Ground rules compliance
└── Enhanced observability
```

---

## Decision Framework

### Go-Live Criteria

✅ **MUST HAVE:**
- [ ] All high/critical CVEs patched
- [ ] Migration safety validated
- [ ] Staging tests pass
- [ ] Security sign-off
- [ ] Rollback tested

⚠️ **SHOULD HAVE (compensate if missing):**
- [ ] Console logging fixed (manual monitoring as backup)
- [ ] Module resolution fixed (build packages first)
- [ ] Load testing complete (conservative scaling)

✨ **NICE TO HAVE (post-launch):**
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] 90% ground rules compliance
- [ ] Enhanced CI gates
- [ ] Bundle size optimization
