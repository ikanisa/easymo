4. Monitor for any regressions
5. Tune performance based on real traffic

### First 3 Months (Major)

‚úÖ **Important Improvements:**
1. Enable TypeScript strict mode (incremental, file-by-file)
2. Achieve 90%+ ground rules compliance
3. Add comprehensive test coverage reporting
4. Implement load testing and performance budgets
5. Enhance CI/CD with SAST tools (CodeQL)

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Compensating Controls (for non-blockers)

#### Console Logging (until fixed)
- Manual log aggregation and monitoring
- Enhanced code review for new logging
- Weekly audit of log statements

#### TypeScript Strictness (until fixed)
- Mandatory null checks in code reviews
- Focus on critical paths (auth, payments)
- Incremental improvement plan

#### Performance (until load tested)
- Conservative auto-scaling settings
- Aggressive monitoring and alerting
- Rapid rollback capability

### Rollback Plan
1. Database: Point-in-time recovery (Supabase automated)
2. Application: Git revert + redeploy (15-minute window)
3. Feature flags: Disable risky features instantly
4. Communication: Incident runbooks established

### Monitoring Strategy
1. **Week 1:** Daily standups, 24/7 on-call
2. **Week 2-4:** Incident reviews, metric tuning
3. **Month 2-3:** Performance optimization, backlog prioritization
