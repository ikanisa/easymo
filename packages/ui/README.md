# UI Package (Strangler Fig)

The future component library for admin and agent surfaces will live here while the legacy implementations continue residing in [`../../src`](../../src) and [`../../admin-app`](../../admin-app).

Start new, shareable UI primitives in this workspace package and adapter shims will expose them back into the existing bundles until we can delete the duplicated widgets.
