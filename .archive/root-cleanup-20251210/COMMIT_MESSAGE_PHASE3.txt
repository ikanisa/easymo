feat(phase3): complete "Use Last Location" button integration for mobility

## Phase 3 Complete - "Use Last Location" Button ✅

### Summary
Upgraded existing "Use Last Location" button implementation to use standardized
modules, added confirmation messages, and full multi-language support.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Mobility Nearby Flow (index.ts)
- Replaced old `getLastLocation()` with standardized `handleUseLastLocation()`
- Added age-aware confirmation message: "Using your location from X minutes ago"
- Added i18n support for all messages

#### 2. Schedule Flow (index.ts)
- Same upgrades as nearby flow
- Consistent UX for scheduled trips

#### 3. Location Prompts (handlers/nearby.ts)
- Button text now i18n: "📍 Use Last Location" / "📍 Utiliser la dernière" / "📍 Koresha aho wahereje"
- Message uses standardized template from shared module
- Automatically includes instructions when recent location available

#### 4. Schedule Buttons (handlers/schedule/booking.ts)
- Button text now i18n
- Consistent with nearby flow

### Features Added

✅ **Age-Aware Confirmations**
  - "Using your location from 15 minutes ago"
  - Shows actual age of cached location

✅ **Multi-Language Support**
  - English, French, Kinyarwanda
  - Button text, prompts, and confirmations

✅ **Standardized Module Integration**
  - Uses `handleUseLastLocation()` from request-location.ts
  - Uses `getLocationReusedMessage()` from messages.ts
  - Uses `getUseLastLocationButton()` from messages.ts
  - Uses `getShareLocationPrompt()` from messages.ts

✅ **Consistent UX**
  - Same behavior in nearby and schedule flows
  - Replicable pattern for other services

### User Experience

**Before:**
- Button: "🕐 Last Location" (hardcoded English)
- No confirmation when used
- User doesn't know if location is recent or old

**After:**
- Button: "📍 Use Last Location" (in user's language)
- Shows confirmation: "Using your location from X minutes ago"
- Clear feedback, multilingual

### Files Modified
